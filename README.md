# 📱 Kubwacu Student App

**Kubwacu Student App** is an open-source **Flutter mobile application**, designed to help university students manage their academic life with ease. Students can access their class schedules, view grades, request official documents, and receive important notifications—all in one place.

This app is part of the broader **Kubwacu Shule** ecosystem, which includes a separate web platform for university staff and teachers (which is not open-sourced). However, the **student app is 100% open-source**.

We believe in open education and digital access, and hope this project helps students and institutions across Africa and beyond to modernize academic systems affordably.
